# Exercise 01

```
An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g. computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Given a string, find out if it satisfies the IPv4 address naming rules.
Example:
a. For inputString = “172.16.254.1”, the output should be: isIPv4Address(inputString) = true
b. For inputString = “172.316.254.1”, the output should be: isIPv4Address(inputString) = false because 316 is not in range [0,255]
c. For inputString = “.254.255.1”, the output should be: isIPv4Address(inputString) = false
```

# Exercise 02

```
Given a rectangular matrix of characters, add a border of asterisks ( * ) to it.
Example: For picture = [“abc”, “ded”] the output should be:
addBorder(picture) = ["****",
 "*abc*",
 "*ded*",
 "****"
 ]
```
